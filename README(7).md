### Networking Lab - 7 

#### OBJECTIVE: 
To configure the routers with a Dynamic Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (R.I.P.)
#### PRE-REQUISITES: 
Cisco packet tracer software installed.
#### DURATION: 
30 min

#### STEPS:

•	Start the packet tracer file included (Lab-7 Start), and have a look at the configuration.

•	The IP addresses have been already inputted to the routers.

•	Go to router 1 and update the RIP database in IP configuration.

•	Repeat the process for router 2 and router 3.

•	Check the connectivity using ping command in command prompt.

•	Alternatively, use a PDU to check connectivity visually.

•	Use “traceroute” command to track the path of the data flow between networks.

#### CONCLUSION:  
This lab is an excellent way to understand the concept of Router information protocol, and visualising the flow of data path. It gives a good practice of updating IP configurations along with RIP database. We can update the IP information ourselves and proceed as well in the first place to have quick refresher on static ip address assignment.
